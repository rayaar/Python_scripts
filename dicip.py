# Just a fun scrit I made, after talking with some friends. 
# It "encrypts" a message by looking up the words in a dictionary, and then
# finds the word on the "oposite side" of the dictionary. it does this for every word, giving 
# a nonsensicall sentence. It can both encrypt and decrypt.
# Also uses fuzzy matching to find closest match if word is not found in dictionary
#
